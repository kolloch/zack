## Artifacts

Build artifacts are the outputs of our build. Ultimately, we want to build 

- an executable,
- a docker image,
- a cloud configuration file,
- ...

to use, distribute and deploy.

Artifacts are all files that we produce on the way and might be inputs or
outputs for our build steps.

## Targets

A target gives a name to a (sub) goal of our build -- producing certain
artifacts or assembling information for our build.
